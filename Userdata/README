User observational data can be put here and read and plotted by ITERA 
 The data should be placed in an ascii file ending with '.data'
 The format should follow what is shown in the example files.
Basically:
 All lines that beging with "%" are taken to be comments
 Data MUST be either comma or tab separated 
 First column is taken to be the label for the data
  following columns are the line fluxes 
  (absolute or relative to H-beta, but must be consistent)
 First Row identifies the lines being used. 
  for now it MUST use the integer identifier in linelist.txt
 Currently Uncertainties cannot be included

The file can include any number of objects, though ITERA is limited 
to 100 by default. Similarly any number of lines may be included, but 
they must be listed n the linelist.txt file currently being used by 
ITERA to be plotted (ie mappings linelist or cloudy linelist).
