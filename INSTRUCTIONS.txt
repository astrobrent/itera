ITERA -- Instructions
==============================================================================

ITERA, the IDL Tool for Emission-line Ratio Analysis, is a tool to enable
astronomers to compare observations of emission line ratios with that
determined by photoionization and shock models.It can also be used as
a predictive tool, to see which line ratios provide strongest
diagnostic for a given physical parameter.

The diagrams are plotted in 2-4 easy steps:
1)Select the emission lines for the ratio, either from the boxes on the
  left or from the "Std. Diagrams" menu.
2)Select which type of models you would like to plot from the tree
  menu next to the line selection boxes
3)Add any data points for comparison.
4)Save the model grids or alter & print the plot using the various
  menu options

1. Emission Lines Selection
--------------------------------------------
On the left side of the ITERA interface are the 4 line selection
boxes (X1, X2, Y1, & Y2), which are used to choose the ratios for the
plot window on the right. The X-axis is given by Log10(X1/X2), while
the Y-Axis is given by Log10(Y1/Y2).

To choose the emission lines simply click on the chosen line in the
relavent selection box. The selected lines are shown in the boxes to
the left of the selection boxes. Multiple lines may be selected and
will be summed. To clear the selected lines, click on the "Clear **"
button below the display boxes.

Several standard emission line ratio diagrams are pre-defined in the 
"Std. Diagrams" menu in the menubar at the top. Selecting one of the 
listed diagrams will automatically select all lines necessary for that 
diagram. As discussed below, the user can add to this list of standard 
diagrams if they wish..

Currently up to 1770 emission lines can be displayed in the selection boxes, 
arising from both atomic and ionized species of 16 elements. The displayed 
lines can be limited through the "LineList" option in the menubar, such 
that only lines in given parameter ranges are displayed.

This full emission line list is based upon the output from the MAPPINGSIII 
photoionization and shock code. The full line list can be extended by the 
user as discussed below, though models which include those lines must also 
be added. 

The "Reset All" button (lower right of ITERA) can also be used to clear all
selected lines and models

2. Select a Model Grid
----------------------
In the middle of ITERA is the model selection tool. There are five folders 
listed, each containing different models.As stated in the README file, 
these directories will be empty unless the associated data files (found 
at the same location as the ITERA program) are installed.

The five folders separate the different classes of models. The first
three represent the main classes of galaxy-scale ionization: Shocks,
AGN and star-formation, while thelast are for user created models and
observations. All of these classes are discussed below.

To select a model, simply choose which class of model, by' expanding'
the directory tree, and descend this tree until the specific model is
found. For example, for pure shock models, we choose the "shock
models" option, then the "shock" option, which then display the list
of possible model series to display (differentiated from the model
class by appearig as a text file.

To choose a model series, simply click on the model. If the emission
lines for the ratios have been selected, the selected model series should
appear in the diagram box to the right.

Multiple model series can be plotted by simply clicking on the
individual models. By default this is limited to 10 models for clarity
and memory efficiency, but this can be altered at start-up by setting:

IDL>itera, max_models=#, 

where # is the maximum number of models you wish to plot. The selected
models are cleared by clicking on the "Clear Selected Models" button.

The "Reset All" button (lower right of ITERA) can also be used to clear all
selected models and lines.


2.1 Model Series
----------------
The individual model series listed in the model tree generally list the
name of the model, and then two out of four free parameters of the
model, with the other two parameters forming the grid that will be
plotted in the diagram to the right. These four parameters that
distinguish the model are:
1) Metallicity: the metallicity (usually relative to Solar) of the
   ionized gas in the model. Abundance variations can also be included
   here.
2) Density: the hydrogen number density of the modelled gas. If the
   gas is isobaric (const. pressure), then this is determined by
   dividing the pressure by kT, generally assuming a temperature of
   T=10,000K. 
3) Model-specific free parameter 2: this parameter is specific to the
   model series, and is most commonly plotted in diagnostic diagrams,
   such as age of an ionizing stellar cluster or power-law index of an
   ionizing AGN spectrum. 
4) Model-specific free parameter 1: This is generally the dominant
   parameter of the model, and also specific to the model
   series. Examples are ionization parameter or shock velocity. 

The latter two parameters can be set to any parameters in the User
specfied models.
Once a model (and line ratios) are selected, a grid of the selected
model series is plotted in the diagnostic diagram on the right. This
grid is formed from the Model-specific free parameter 1, and one of
the fist three parameters. Which of these parameters is plotted is
determined by the "2nd Parameter for Grid" selection box, which is set
to the Unique Parameter (Model-specific free parameter 2) by
default. The other two parameters are fixed to the values listed in
the model series name in the model selection box.

2.2 Model Description
---------------------
Below the model selection box is a small text box which describes the
last selected model. On five lines you have:

Model name    : This generally describes the mode such as "shock" or
      	      	"Dusty AGN".
Metallicity   : This gives the value (or range) of the metallcity in
      	      	the selected models. This is generally given as either
      	      	a multiple of solar metallicity or a reference to the
      	      	abundances. 
Density	      : This is the number density of hydrogen
      	      	(in cm^-3). If an isobaric model, T=10,000 K is
      	      	assumed. 
Parameter 2   : This gives the secondary unique parameter for the
      	      	models (ie magnetic field B or starburst age etc). See
      	      	references for units.
Parameter 1   : This is the dominant parameter of the models (such as
      	      	ionization parameter) and always given as a range. See
      	      	references for units.  

2.3 Limiting Parameter Ranges
-----------------------------
The two parameters chosen for the grid to be plotted on the diagram
can be limitted to a smaller range or even single values by clicking
the "Limit Parameter Ranges" button. A pop-up box will appear with the
current ranges of the two parameters (as labelled) based upon the
first model selected. 


3. The Diagnostic Diagram
-------------------------
The far right of the ITERA display is the emission-line ratio diagnostic
diagram window. Once the emission lines and the model(s) have been
selected, the chosen diagram will appear in the window, showing the
model grids for the selected models and lines.
This diagram will automatically update with added models or lines, or changes
in the model range. 


3.1 Zoom
--------
There are two ways in which to zoom in on the diagram.
The first is a dynamic box zoom, where by clicking in the plot window
and dragging the box you can zoom in to the desired size.  Note that
this box can be outside the marked axes.
The second is the stated ranges below the display window. These show
the current X & Y ranges and can be changed by either typing in the
desired min & max values or by dragging the slide bars. The ranges are
limited to -10 to 10, given that observations outside this dynamic
range are unlikely.

This range can be reset to the default -3 to 3 for both axes by
clicking on the "Reset Range" button. 

3.2 Grid Labels
---------------
There are a choice of 3 labels for the shown diagnostic diagram,
selected by clicking on the button in the "Labels" box:
"None"	    : No labels are shown on the diagram. Select this for
	      clarity. ITERA starts off with this option.
"Colours"   : Colour bars are displayed to the left of the
	      diagram,displaying both the name and selected values of
	      the grid.
"Grid Vals" : Selected values of the grid are shown, next to the
	      grid. With parameter 1 values listed at low P2 side, and
	      parameter 2 values listed at the high P1 side. Note that
	      as this is automatically generated, it occassionally
	      will become confused with the grid.

4. Observational Data
----------------------
User observational data can be added through the "Add Data" button to
the lower right of ITERA. Note that this can only be used when the four
lines for the diagram are selected. Clicking on this will bring up a
box with two buttons at the top, a display table and the "Ok" and
"Cancel" buttons.

Clicking on the "Add Data Point" will bring up another window where
the X & Y values (the currently displayed line ratios) of the
observation can be entered, along with a label for the observational
point. 

If multiple observational data exists, then this can be read in via
a file. Clicking on the  "Read Data File" will bring up a file window
where the data file can be entered and read in. 
The data file must be in a specific format. Any line beginning
with '%' or ';' is taken as a comment. The lines containing data  MUST
have the X and Y values first (in that order). Any data after these is
taken as a label for that data point (INCLUDE EXAMPLE FILE?).

Once data is entered it appears in the display table. Futher data can
be added by clicking either the "Add Data Point" or "Read Data File"
buttons. This data can then be plotted by Clicking "Ok" or cleared by
clicking on "Cancel".

This data only applies to the current diagram. If either the models or
lines are cleared, the data is cleared as well.

5.Exporting the Data
--------------------
Once a line ratio diagram has been chosen and filled with the chosen
models and explored, it can be exported in two ways. The diagram can
be directly printed to an encapsulated postscript file by clicking on
the "File" menu button and then "Print" button, where the name of the
output file can be chosen. The printed file will appear exactly as in
the display window, with the chosen model and plot ranges, and grid
labelling. 

The chosen line ratios for the model grids can also be exported by the
"save Grids" option in the "File" menu. This will save chosen
models in a file, listing in six columns; the parameter 2 values, the
parameter 1 values and the fluxes of the chosen emission lines (or
sums) relative to the H-beta line.
These files can then be used for User defined plots, or re-read into
the ITERA procedures (see "Command-line Options" below).

6. Model data
------------------------
The data for the models is found in four subdirectories within the
ITERA directory (AGNdata,Shockdata, SBdata, Userdata.  
The models appear as HDF files, separated by directory
structure into different model runs (Shock,shock+precursor etc). 
The base-level model runs for ITERA are provided as tar files,
obtainable from the same website as ITERA.  

Each model run
is separated into HDF-format files, with each file containing a model
run of given gas metallicity, gas density and model defined parameter,
as listed in the file name. Within each
file is the line flux for all available lines for a series in the
model specific "parameter 1", as well as the values for all model
parameters. These files can be read into IDL using the "HDF2STRUCT"
procedure supplied with ITERA. 

6.1 User Generated models
------------------------
User generated models can be placed in the Userdata directory. These
must be in the same HDF format as the other data. Two programs
(CONVERT_MAPSPECFILE and CONVERT_MAPSPEC) are provided to convert
MAPPINGS III generated spectral files into the necessary HDF file 
(a single file or a series of spec** respectively).Programs for other
photoionization codes such as CLOUDY are currently being written.
